## The Plan
It's December 2025 and I'm currently in between graduating (a semester late) and my full time role at Pinterest. It was nice to have a relaxing month at home celebrating Christmas with the family and hanging out with my girlfriend Philly but how could I spend three months at home just bed rotting? With that in mind, I figured going on a trip out of the country was the best way to spend some cash I earned from my internship and explore new cities all by myself.

**But where do I go?** I've been to a few other cities in Europe [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome), [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence), and [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice), which were all amazing cities and where I had an amazing time but I needed somewhere new and exciting but not *too* extreme. I had two weeks to spend my time and knew that I wanted to hit multiple cities, so I went to what some would consider a "starter" country for travel, Spain. 

Now Spain is *hugeeee* with so much to do, and now that I have a decision on which country I want to go to, I sadly have to find a flight and hopefully one where I don't lose all of my money. My amazing brother came in clutch here when coming home one night, he decided:

> Ben, you are gonna go on this trip. Lets get you a dang flight before you end up not going

So with the help of my brother we found an amazing deal for a roundtrip flight on **Delta** (how fancy) to [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid) for only $358 (usually $400+)! 

*Okay, I just said I wanted to hit two countries, and now that we have an entry point. Its time to decide what cities I am going to go to and which Country I want to visit close to spain* 

Which leaves me with an obvious answer since its so close: **Portugal**! With the second country decided, my brother sat down and built out a route which is feasible for two weeks but would not leave me fighting tooth and nail to hit every site in the city and then run to the next.

Madrid -> Seville -> Lisbon -> Porto. Four amazing cities within 16 days. 
## The Route:
> [!NOTE]
> *Ignore my funny drawing (its my first time making one of these)*
> **AND** -- Yes, I have to fly back to Madrid to catch my returning flight instead of flying out of Porto (oops!)

### Transportation
As you can see there needs to be a way to get to each city, especially getting from Spain to Portugal (as I hinted above). Luckily Europe has an extensive train network which makes everything so much easier.

**NYC ✈️ Madrid 🚄 Seville ✈️ Lisbon 🚄 Porto ✈️ Madrid ✈️ NYC**  

With the route planned it was time to leave on January 15th! Off to Madrid I go!
