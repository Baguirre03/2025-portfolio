excerpt: "How shooting photos improved my eye for UI and developer experience."

Balancing photography with programming has changed the way I design and build software. Looking through a lens trained me to appreciate composition, contrast, and negative space—principles that translate directly into UI.

## What photography taught me about UI

- Focal points help users know where to look first
- Light and contrast map to hierarchy and emphasis
- Simplicity wins—remove distractions to guide attention

## Applying it to code

- Clear component boundaries = clean composition
- Consistent spacing scales like a grid system
- Strong defaults reduce cognitive load

I now prototype with the same mindset I use when composing a shot: identify the subject, frame it well, and remove everything that doesn’t support the story.
