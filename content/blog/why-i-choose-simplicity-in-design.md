excerpt: "Practical principles for shipping clear, usable interfaces."

Complexity creeps in one micro-decision at a time. The fastest way to ship better software is to aggressively prefer simple solutions that users immediately understand.

## Principles I follow

- Name things so they don’t need tooltips
- Prefer one obvious path over many clever ones
- Remove options until confusion disappears

## Results

Simplicity de-risks handoffs, reduces bugs, and keeps momentum high. Most importantly, it respects users’ time.
