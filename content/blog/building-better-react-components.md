# Building Better React Components with TypeScript

TypeScript has revolutionized the way we write React components. In this post, I'll share some patterns and best practices I've learned for creating more maintainable and type-safe components.

## Proper Component Props Interface

One of the first things I always do is create a clear interface for component props:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: "primary" | "secondary" | "danger";
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant,
  size = "medium",
  disabled = false,
  onClick,
  children,
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

## Generic Components

Generic components are incredibly powerful for reusability:

```typescript
interface ListProps<T> {
  items: T[];
  renderItem: (item: T) => React.ReactNode;
  keyExtractor: (item: T) => string;
}

export function List<T>({ items, renderItem, keyExtractor }: ListProps<T>) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={keyExtractor(item)}>{renderItem(item)}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Always define proper TypeScript interfaces for props
2. Use generic components for maximum reusability
3. Leverage TypeScript's type inference where possible
4. Don't over-type - let TypeScript do the work

These patterns have significantly improved my React development workflow and component reliability.
